# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction
This repository contains a **Supervised Machine Learning** project to classify whether water is **potable (safe to drink) or not** based on various chemical properties.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key water quality parameters.
- Trained **Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree** classifiers.
- Achieved **92.5% accuracy** using the **Random Forest Classifier**.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Water Quality Test Project.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full code.
- `water_potability.csv` â†’ Dataset *(if public, or provide a source link)*.
- `Water_Quality_Report.pdf` â†’ Project summary.
- `images/` â†’ Folder containing key visualizations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/2-0-0-5-emil/Water-Quality-Prediction.git
2. Open `Advance House Price Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model!
